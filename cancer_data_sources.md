## Publicly Available Cancer Research Datasets

Based on the initial search, several promising sources for publicly available cancer research datasets have been identified. These sources offer a variety of data types, from genomic and clinical to imaging and epidemiological data, suitable for different analytical approaches.

### Key Data Sources:

1.  **Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC)**: This is a highly comprehensive resource providing access to open, registered, and controlled datasets from NCI- and NIH-funded programs, as well as external cancer programs. It is likely to contain a wide range of data types relevant to cancer research, including genomic, proteomic, and clinical data.
    *   **URL**: `https://datacommons.cancer.gov/explore/datasets`

2.  **The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA)**: A landmark cancer genomics program that has sequenced and molecularly characterized over 11,000 cases of primary cancer samples across 33 cancer types. This is an excellent source for genomic, epigenomic, and proteomic data.
    *   **URL**: `https://www.cancer.gov/ccg/research/genome-sequencing/tcga`
    *   **Related Portal**: UCSC Xena (`https://xena.ucsc.edu/`) allows exploration of TCGA, GDC, and other public cancer genomics resources, with over 1500 datasets and 50+ cancer types.

3.  **U.S. Cancer Statistics Public Use Database - CDC**: This database provides cancer incidence and population data for all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. It is particularly useful for epidemiological studies and understanding cancer trends at a population level.
    *   **URL**: `https://www.cdc.gov/united-states-cancer-statistics/public-use/index.html`

4.  **The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA)**: A service that de-identifies and hosts a large archive of medical images of cancer, accessible for public download. This resource is crucial for projects involving medical image analysis and AI applications in diagnostics.
    *   **URL**: `https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/`

5.  **International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting (ICCR)**: Provides datasets developed to ensure consistent and evidence-based reporting of cancer. This could be valuable for projects focusing on data standardization and reporting.
    *   **URL**: `https://www.iccr-cancer.org/datasets/published-datasets/`

6.  **Data.gov**: A general repository that lists various datasets, including some related to cancer. A specific dataset mentioned contains volume for 11 types of cancer (bladder, breast, brain, colon, esophagus, liver, lung, pancreas, prostate, rectum, and stomach).
    *   **URL**: `https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/?tags=cancer`

7.  **MSK Library Guides - Artificial Intelligence - Datasets**: Mentions a searchable database of over 2,000 research data repositories, including 100+ relating to cancer. This could serve as a meta-resource to discover more specific datasets.
    *   **URL**: `https://libguides.mskcc.org/artificial_intelligence/datasets`

These sources provide a strong foundation for a cancer research project involving data analysis and AI, offering diverse data types for various research questions.
